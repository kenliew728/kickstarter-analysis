# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign
---
## **Overview of Project**
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to analyze the trend of kickstarter campaign outcome relative to the launch date and funding goals. The theater as parent category and plays as subcategory will be the primary focus of the study spanning from the year 2009 to 2017.
### Analysis and Challenges
#### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*
A new data set, year, is added to the new column created on the kickstarter tab in order to extract the year from the "Date Created Conversion" column. The next step is to create a pivot table that consist of the parent category and year as filter and date created and count of outcomes as results. Based on the results, there were a total of 1,369 kickstarter campaigns launched during the study period. The study outcome can be summarized in the table below.  
|   Results   | Count |
| ----------- | ----- | 
| Successful  |  839  |
| Failed      |  493  |
| Canceled    |  37   |
| Total       | 1397  |
#### *Theater Outcome vs. Launch Month Trend Chart*
A line chart is plotted to visualize the trend of funding goals relative the the month where the kickstarter is launched.

#### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*
A second study was added to understand the outcomes of kickstarter campaign based on funding goal. To begin the study, a table was created with columns to hold the data for range of funding goals, number of successful, failed, and canceled campaign, total projects, percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaign. Using the "CountIfs" function, each column was reference to the kickstarter worksheet to extract the data. Once all the data is populated, a line chart is plotted to visualize the trend of funding goal range relative to the campaign outcomes. The line chart allow us to draw further conclusion on whethe the range of funding goals influence the outcome of the campaign.

#### *Challenges and Difficulties Encountered*
The report compilation was not without its challenges. It was not easy to figure out on how to insert screen shot into a Github readme content. I was able to research through Google on some of the method used to insert screen shot. The one I picked was to drag my PNG file into the Github's issues tab and copy and paste the link created into Github's readme content. The end results were satisfactory. The next challenge was to create the right header and table format. I was able to learn the basic wrtting and formatting syntax through the link provided on the module and was able to try different syntaxes in this kickstarter report.
