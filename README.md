### Analysis and Challenges
#### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*
A new data set, year, is added to a new column in order to extract the year from the "Date Created Conversion" column. The next step is to create a pivot table to create a table that consist of the parent category and year as filter and date created and count of outcomes as results. Based on the results, there were a total of 1,369 kickstarter campaigns launched during the study period. The study outcome can be summarized in the table below.  
|   Results   | Count |
| ----------- | ----- | 
| Successful  |  839  |
| Failed      |  493  |
| Canceled    |  37   |
